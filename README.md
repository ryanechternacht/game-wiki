# game-wiki

An attempt to build a wiki that is fit for board games (e.g. searchable card libraries, living rulebook, etc.).

Doubling as a chance to develop vue.js outside of work and build an [api in clojure](https://github.com/ryanechternacht/game-wiki-api). The API is still WIP for now, so this just hosts dummy data in vuex for now. 

This project uses:
- vue
- vuex
- vue-bootstrap

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```
